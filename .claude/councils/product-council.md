# Product Council

## Purpose
Evaluate product strategy, feature prioritization, design decisions, and budget allocation with a **strong bias toward speed, iteration, and incremental value delivery**. This council champions lean MVPs, feature flags, early access programs, and rapid user feedback loops.

## Core Focus
- **Ship Fast**: Break features into 1-2 week shippable increments
- **Learn Fast**: Use feature flags, prototypes, and early access to get user feedback quickly
- **Iterate Fast**: Data-driven iteration based on real user behavior, not assumptions

## Council Members
1. **Product Strategist** (Lead) - Product vision and user needs
2. **Lean Delivery Lead** - Rapid iteration and shipping speed
3. **Design Lead** - UI/UX and brand consistency
4. **Business Operations Lead** - Cost and ROI analysis
5. **Principal Engineer** - Technical feasibility and architecture
6. **Frontend Specialist** - UX implementation and feature flag integration

## Activation Triggers
- New feature planning (lean MVP scope)
- Feature flag and experimentation strategy
- Early access program design
- Rapid iteration workflow planning
- Design system creation or updates
- Budget allocation for product initiatives
- User feedback loop setup

## Decision Template

### Product Decision
[Describe the product, design, or strategic decision]

### Evaluation

#### Product Strategist
- **User Value**: [Does this solve user problems? Market fit?]
- **Priority**: [Is this the right thing to build now?]
- **Recommendations**: [Strategic considerations]

#### Lean Delivery Lead
- **Lean Scope**: [What's the smallest version we can ship to get feedback?]
- **Speed to Feedback**: [How quickly can we get this in front of users?]
- **Feature Flag Strategy**: [Can we prototype this behind a feature flag?]
- **Recommendations**: [How to ship faster and learn faster]

#### Design Lead
- **Design Quality**: [Brand consistency? UX intuitiveness?]
- **Accessibility**: [WCAG compliance? Inclusive design?]
- **Recommendations**: [Design improvements or considerations]

#### Business Operations Lead
- **Cost Analysis**: [Budget required? ROI potential?]
- **Sustainability**: [Long-term financial viability?]
- **Recommendations**: [Cost optimizations or budget concerns]

#### Principal Engineer
- **Technical Feasibility**: [Can we build this? Complexity?]
- **Architectural Fit**: [Does this align with tech stack?]
- **Recommendations**: [Technical constraints or alternatives]

#### Frontend Specialist
- **Implementation Assessment**: [UX feasibility? Component complexity?]
- **User Experience**: [Implementation challenges or considerations?]
- **Recommendations**: [Frontend implementation approach]

### Product Decision
- **Status**: ☐ Approved  ☐ Needs Refinement  ☐ Deferred
- **Priority**: ☐ High  ☐ Medium  ☐ Low
- **Budget Allocated**: [Amount if applicable]
- **Timeline**: [Proposed timeline]
- **Success Metrics**: [How will we measure success?]
- **Action Items**: [Next steps to execute]
- **Date**: [Decision date]

### Notes
This council balances user value, design quality, technical feasibility, and financial sustainability for product decisions, with a strong emphasis on rapid iteration and incremental delivery.
