# Backend API Development Workflow

> [!WARNING]
> **Phase 2 skill — not yet genericized.** This skill retains tech-stack-specific references and is hidden from skills.sh discovery. It will be transformed to a stack-agnostic format in a future release.

Build backend API endpoints, services, and database changes following clean architecture conventions.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Scope boundary**: This skill implements backend code and commits it. It does **NOT** create pull requests, push to remote, run code reviews, or submit anything for merge. When implementation and commits are complete, **stop** and suggest the user run `/review-code` next.

See the full workflow in `.claude/skills/build-api/SKILL.md`.
