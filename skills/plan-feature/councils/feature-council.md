# Feature Council

## Purpose

Plan and evaluate new feature implementations from frontend, backend, and quality perspectives before coding begins.

## Council Members

1. **Principal Engineer** (Lead) - Architecture fit
2. **Frontend Specialist** - UI/UX implementation
3. **Backend Specialist** - API and business logic
4. **QA Lead** - Testing strategy

## Activation Triggers

- New feature planning (before implementation)
- Major refactoring of existing features
- UI/UX architectural changes
- Cross-stack features (frontend + backend)
- User-facing functionality changes
